    "\n",
    "Key Features of a Heatmap\n",
    "Color Coding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Representation: Each cell in the matrix is colored according to its data value, with the color intensity typically representing the magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient: A color gradient (from light to dark or using different hues) indicates the range of data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Density:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Representation: Heatmaps are effective for visualizing large amounts of data compactly, making it easy to spot trends and variations at a glance.\n",

    "Q21. why is Numpys array slicing faster than pythons list slicing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: NumPy's array slicing is faster than Python's list slicing due to several key factors related to the underlying implementation and optimization of NumPy arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "Memory Layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "Contiguous Memory: NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, which allows for efficient access and manipulation of data.\n",
    "This layout makes it possible to use vectorized operations and reduces the overhead of accessing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointer Overhead: Python lists are arrays of pointers to objects, which means each element access involves additional dereferencing and pointer arithmetic. This increases the overhead and slows down the slicing operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homogeneous Data Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Data Type: NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements have the same data type.\n",
    "This uniformity allows for efficient memory usage and faster computations using specialized low-level implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous Data Types: Python lists can contain elements of different types, which adds complexity and overhead when performing operations like slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimized Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization: NumPy uses vectorized operations, which are implemented in C and leverage SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions. These operations are highly optimized and can process multiple data points simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted Code: Python lists use interpreted loops for slicing and other operations, which are inherently slower due to the overhead of the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underlying Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Algorithms: NumPy's array slicing is backed by efficient, low-level algorithms that minimize overhead and maximize performance. These algorithms take advantage of modern CPU architectures and cache hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generic Implementations: Python list slicing is designed to be general-purpose and flexible, but this flexibility comes at the cost of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Here’s a comparison of slicing a NumPy array and a Python list:\n",

    "Expected Output\n",
    "NumPy array slicing time: 0.000010 seconds\n",
    "Python list slicing time: 0.002500 seconds\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Memory Layout: NumPy arrays use contiguous memory, reducing overhead.\n",

    "Homogeneous Data: NumPy arrays have uniform data types, enabling optimized computations.\n",
